# GM2Godot

![SCREENSHOT1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/831a2cee-22b0-4a0d-9d08-810ab725da52)

GM2Godot is a tool which converts GameMaker (2024.8.1) projects to Godot (4.3) projects.
This repository is work in progress but [feel free to help!](https://github.com/Infiland/GM2Godot/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

# What it is and what it isn't

When presenting this tool, I've gotten a couple of questions what the tool really is and what it is supposed to be, so I'll break it down.

**GM2Godot is:**
- A tool that ports assets from GameMaker to Godot
- Is for people who don't want to port the GameMaker project to Godot from scratch
- Not perfect. It will make mistakes.

**GM2Godot isn't:**
- For people who expect everything will work perfectly.
- A compiler that can seamlessly transpile GML to GDScript *(yet)*
- This isn't a tool which turns COMPILED GM projects to Godot, [use UndertaleToolMod instead](https://github.com/UnderminersTeam/UndertaleModTool)

Contribution is found in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Infiland/GM2Godot/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). But pretty much fork the repo, do pull requests and I'll try to code review them.

# Installation

Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Infiland/GM2Godot
```
Open VSC and install Python 3.9.0 or later (I haven't tested older python versions)
```
py --version
```
[You can download python here.](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

If you are Linux, **you are required to have Tkinter module**, do the following: (tested this on Ubuntu, so it probably works on debian based systems)
```
sudo apt-get install python3-tk python3-pil python3-pil.imagetk python3-markdown2
```
(if tkhtmlview is a problem, please use pip install tkhtmlview --break-system-packages)

The program requires the following libraries to use
```
pip install Pillow markdown2 tkhtmlview
```
*(If you have Pillow installed, version 8.0.0 or newer is required)*

Once installed, you can run the program:
```
python main.py
```

# How to use
The tool will open a GUI menu upon running main.py.

At the top, place the GameMaker directory and the Godot directory in each textbox.
NOTE: Godot directory needs to be completely empty to avoid data loss, GameMaker should stay as is.

Once you put both directories in the tool, you can choose in settings what you want to port and press the "Convert" button.

It will then start taking assets from GameMaker and port them into your empty Godot project.
The tool will be done when it says so in the console and when the progress bar is at 100%.
